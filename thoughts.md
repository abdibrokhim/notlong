[part 2]
[premium features]

let's work on premium features.
we need a new table. `connected_wallets` table.
we have following columns: `id`, `wallet_address`, `tries_left`, and `created_at`.


[draft]

user should to pay extra $0.99 usd for each url shortening if they wanna use advanced features.

1. encrypt stored URLs to enhance security and protect user data.
2. custom url aliases.
3. expiration dates.

they can select all three at ones or any of them just paying $0.99 usd.

okey , about:

QR Code Generation. i believe we should take another $0.99 usd for this feature.

API Access - for developers. will think about it later.

maybe i will introduce just monthly subscription for advanced features.
